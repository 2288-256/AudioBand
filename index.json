    "keywords": "Project layout Last commit at this time of writing / update: a554bd34d3ea30f32b2819e35fba4130fd08af33 Here are the main projects in the solution: AudioBand : The is the \"main\" project where audioband lives AudioBand.Logging : This project contains shared logging facilities AudioBand.AudioSource : This project contains the audiosource interface AudioSourceHost : This project contains the assembly used to host an audio source in a separate app domain * AudioSource : These are the projects for the included audio sources. AudioBand project Entry point The entry point for audioband can be found in the Deskband.cs file. This is the composition root of the application. It's the equivalent of the main function in a normal winforms or wpf application but instead of calling Application.Run() , the user control is instantiated directly. The toolbar is implemented as a WPF usercontrol in Views/AudioBandToolbar.xaml AudioBandToolbar.xaml This is the top level user control, equivalent to the main window in wpf or main form in winforms. Codebehind The codebehind listens to size changes and notifies windows to update the deskband size. ViewModel The viewmodel for the toolbar can be found in ViewModels/AudioBandToolbarViewModel . It handles the context menu, loading the audio sources, and updating other view models when the audio source changes. Audio source loading Audio source loading is done by the AudioSource/AudioSourceManager class. Each audio source is loaded in their own app domain using the AudioSourceHost project. The creation and communication with the app domain is done through the AudioSource/AudioSourceProxy class. Currently, all audio sources are loaded at the start by the toolbar viewmodel, and there is no file system monitoring for new sources. When new audio sources are added, these steps are performed: Add to the observable collection for the context menu Merge settings. If there are already saved settings for the audio source, then the settings are applied to the audio source If there are no previously saved settings, then the default setting values are extracted and saved Viewmodels for these settings are built and added so they can be manipulated by the settings window If the audio source is selected in the settings, then it is activated. App settings loading App settings are loaded by the Settings/AppSettings class. It is just simple serialization in the toml format. Toml is used because at the start of the project, configuration was simple and the ability to change the values outside of audioband was desired. Toml was a good use case for that. Now, the settings have more nesting and more lists, it is less readable with toml but it is still workable. There is also a Migrations subfolder that contains code to settings migrations. These classes update old configuration files to the latest format. ViewModels No MVVM frameworks are used, instead there is a ViewModelBase implementation and standard ICommand implementations. ViewModelBase provides automatic implementations for INotifyPropertyChanged : Has a SetProperty method that automatically calls INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged event if a field value changes. The attribute AlsoNotify can also be applied to raise PropertyChanged for other properties. Example: [AlsoNotify(nameof(Size))] public int Width { get => _width; set => SetProperty(ref _width, value); } public Size Size => new Size(Width, Height); INotifyDataError : Provides a few RaiseValidationError methods that raise the INotifyDataError.ErrorsChanged event. IResettable : Custom interface that exposes a method to reset the viewmodel to default values. The base class implements a command to call reset and the method ResetObject<T> to reset an object to its default value. BeginEdit , EndEdit and CancelEdit commands and methods. The attribute TrackState can is used to automatically call those methods. // Automatically calls beginedit method if the value is changed [TrackState] public int Width { get => Model.Width; // Using the model as the source for the value set => SetProperty(Model, nameof(Model.Width), value); // Set the value in the model } Views The xaml is store under the Views folder. Message bus Under the Messages folder there is a simple IMessageBus interface. Messages are used sparingly for communicating between the settings window <-> toolbar and between view models. Behaviors Dpi Since we are in an interop scenario, there are some issues with automatic dpi handling so it is done manually through the DpiScaling behavior. AudioSourceHost project The AudioSourceHost project is a library to load an audio source and exposes it via MarshalByRef objects for cross app domain communication. It uses the Microsoft Extensibility Framework to locate and load an IAudioSource ."

Clone the repo git clone git@github.com:dsafa/audio-band.git Open the solution file under src/AudioBand.sln in visual studio. Restore nuget packages before building The toolbar will have to be installed after being built. Note Explorer does not unload audioband so you will not be able to build if explorer has loaded it. The debug configuration will automatically close explorer to build the audioband project and restart it after the build. Running local version To test the local version of audioband, it needs to be installed as a toolbar. The easiest way is to copy the install script from tools/install.cmd to the build folder and run it. Warning Installing the development version will overwrite any other installations. Debugging There are 2 ways you can use a debugger on audioband. Attach the debugger: In visual studio, open the attach to process menu (ctrl + alt + p). Select explorer.exe and click attach. Inserting the statement System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch(); will allow you to attach a debugger at any place in the code. This is useful if you need the debugger at the start. Running unit tests You may notice that there is a configuration called Test . This is so that it is easier to run tests without having to restart explorer to build the project. Since the dlls will be in use by explorer, switching to the test configuration allows the project to be built. Otherwise, it should be identical to the debug configuration."
