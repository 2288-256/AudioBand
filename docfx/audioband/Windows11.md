# Windows 11 Installation
The installation process is very similar to installing on Windows 10, and once installed, everything is the same as on Windows 10.

In order for AudioBand to run properly, we have to patch the Taskbar using an external tool.

## Step 1: Patching The Taskbar
There are 2 tools to achieve this, they're both super easy to install but they have some different functionalities.  
Information on these tools can be found at the bottom of this page if you're interested.

If you just want to patch it, [Download ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/releases/latest/download/ep_setup.exe) and just run the install. Nothing else should be required.

> [!NOTE]
> To change settings of the ExplorerPatcher, you just right click the Taskbar and click on Properties.

## Step 2: Installing AudioBand
Now you just install AudioBand like you would before.
Get the [Latest Download](https://github.com/AudioBand/AudioBand/releases/latest/download/audioband.msi) and run it, and you're good to go.

## Extra Info: Taskbar Patchers
If you'd like some more info on the choices of Taskbar Patchers, this is the place.

There are two options, namely [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/) and [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher).

A feature list can be found on the pages there.  
Normally, these apps are made by the same guy, the only difference is that `ExplorerPatcher` is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) but it doesn't have all the functionality that `StartAllBack` has.

However, `StartAllBack` is proprietary software.
